- 👋 Hi community, I’m @jcarrerz89 on this matter, Jimmy Carrera Zambrano on real life. Chilean born, currently living and working in Auckland, New Zealand. 
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, entrepreneurship, and not less importantly, travels! Spanish native speaker, fluent in English, poor French but improving. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about everything about software development, cloud-based services, architecture, and how to build better software. Grown-up as a Java developer, now exploring the capabilities of PHP with Laravel, but keen on jumping to probably, Phyton for the future. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on microservices projects with Java or Phyton, React, GraphQL projects.
